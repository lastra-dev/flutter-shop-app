## Quickstart

Get the Flutter Sdk: [official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/lastra-dev/flutter-shop-app/

Create a Firebase project with email authentication  
Make .env file with your [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) URL and your Firebase project WEB API KEY (see .env.example)


## What's included

* CRUD: create, read, update and delete operations with Firebase!
* Responsive layout
* Linting with 'Linter' dart package
* Environment variables with 'flutter_dotenv' dart package
* Async HTTP requests to Firebase REST API with HTTP dart package (You should use the firebase package instead. I used HTTP package to learn how to work with different backends)
* Animations: Hero, SlideTransition and FadeTransition

### Firebase

This repo is using Firebase. It uses the Realtime Database to save user products and orders and authentication to signup users to the app.

### Animations
I use AnimationControllers, AnimationContainers, and route animations to run these animations:
* Hero Animation
* SlideTransition
* FadeTransition
